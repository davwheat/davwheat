# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**davwheat/davwheat** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm **David Wheatley**, a 16 year old all-round developer from West Sussex, England.

I enjoy all sorts of programming, from mobile apps to WinForms to GTA V multiplayer plugins, but I tend to focus more heavily on web development.
