# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **David Wheatley**, a 17 year old all-round developer from West Sussex, England.

I enjoy all sorts of programming, from mobile apps to WinForms to GTA V multiplayer plugins, but I tend to focus more heavily on web development.

### Historical COVID-19 briefings

I'm working on a full history of COVID-19 in the UK, including all England government briefings, a timeline of events, and more.
